# Security Improvements Summary

## 1. Strong JWT Secret Key ✓
- Generated a cryptographically secure 256-bit secret key
- Updated `.env` file with the new secret
- Modified `config.py` to require environment variable (no hardcoded default)

## 2. Rate Limiting ✓
Implemented rate limiting using `slowapi` on critical endpoints:
- `/auth/token` - 5 requests per minute
- `/auth/register` - 5 requests per minute  
- `/demo/generate` - 10 requests per minute
- `/demo/quick-signup` - 5 requests per minute
- `/scope/generate` - 20 requests per minute

## 3. httpOnly Cookies ✓
- Modified login endpoint to set JWT in httpOnly cookie
- Added cookie support to `get_current_user` function
- Created `get_current_user_with_cookie` for endpoints needing cookie auth
- Added logout endpoint to clear cookies
- Implemented CSRF protection with double-submit cookie pattern

## 4. Stripe Webhook Verification ✓
- Added signature verification for Stripe webhooks
- Uses `stripe.Webhook.construct_event()` to validate payloads
- Added `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to environment variables
- Falls back to direct parsing only if webhook secret not configured

## Configuration Updates Required

Add these to your production `.env` file:
```
# Generate new secret for production
SECRET_KEY=<your-production-secret-key>

# Stripe webhook endpoint secret from Stripe dashboard
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

## Frontend Updates Needed

To fully utilize httpOnly cookies, the frontend should:
1. Include credentials in API requests: `credentials: 'include'`
2. Read CSRF token from response and include in headers
3. Remove localStorage token storage
4. Use the cookie-based authentication

## Deployment Considerations

1. Ensure HTTPS is enabled (cookies have `secure=True`)
2. Configure proper CORS settings for your domain
3. Set up Stripe webhook endpoint in Stripe dashboard
4. Monitor rate limiting logs for potential adjustments
