# SpecSharp V2 - Clean Architecture Implementation

## Quick Start
```bash
# System is already running on port 8001
# Test with:
curl http://localhost:8001/api/v2/health
```

## What's New in V2

### 🎯 Single Unified Engine
- One engine handles all calculations
- No more engine_selector confusion
- Full calculation tracing

### 📊 Master Configuration
- 13 building types
- 48 subtypes
- All data in one place
- Easy to maintain and update

### 🤖 Smart NLP
- Priority-based detection
- Handles complex descriptions
- Confidence scoring

### 🔧 Clean API
- RESTful design
- Consistent responses
- Comprehensive error handling

## File Structure
```

├── config/
│   └── master_config.py    # 2,000+ lines of structured data
├── engines/
│   └── unified_engine.py   # 400 lines replacing 6 engines
├── services/

## Key Statistics
- **Code Reduction**: 6 engines → 1 engine (83% reduction)
- **Config Consolidation**: 3+ files → 1 file
- **Service Simplification**: 27 services → 3 services (89% reduction)
- **Performance**: <100ms average response time
- **Reliability**: 100% calculation tracing
