# Building Type: <TYPE>

## Underwriting model
- Category: NOI / Operating / Throughput / Public-feasibility / Mixed
- Primary valuation method: cap_rate / payback / hybrid / none
- Recommendation logic: (what gates drive GO/NO-GO/NEEDS WORK)

## Primary metrics (must output)
- <metric 1>
- <metric 2>

## Revenue model (deterministic)
Inputs:
- <driver 1>
Formula (conceptual):
- <one-line deterministic structure>

## Cost intensity model (deterministic)
Inputs:
- <driver 1>
Notes:
- <MEP/finish/sitework intensity drivers>

## Financing & lender logic (deterministic)
- DSCR targets:
- LTC targets:
- Debt sizing method:

## Trace requirements
- Required trace steps for this type:
  - <step_id>

## Subtype inheritance rules
- What subtypes may override:
  - revenue intensity
  - finish level
  - MEP intensity
  - staffing assumptions
  - margins
  - risk tolerance
