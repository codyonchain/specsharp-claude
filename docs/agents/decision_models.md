# SpecSharp Decision Models (Canonical)

## NOI / cap-rate assets
Revenue → NOI → value via cap rate.
Primary metrics: NOI, DSCR, yield on cost, exit value.

## Operating business assets
Revenue → operating margin → cash flow.
Primary metrics: payback, cash-on-cash, margin durability.
No forced cap-rate terminal value.

## Throughput-driven healthcare/specialty
Units × throughput × reimbursement OR lease model (MOB).
Primary metrics: DSCR + unit economics + risk flags.

## Public/institutional feasibility
No revenue underwriting by default.
Primary outputs: cost, schedule risk, program metrics, budget fit.

## Mixed-use sum-of-parts
Underwrite each component with its native model and combine deterministically.
