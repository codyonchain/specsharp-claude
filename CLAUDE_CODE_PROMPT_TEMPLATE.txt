Update the project cards in the Dashboard with better styling and polish. Don't add new data fields, just improve visual design.

Improvements to make:
1. Enhanced styling - modern, slick design with better visual hierarchy
2. Add "last updated" timestamp using project.updated_at (format as "Updated 2 days ago" or "Updated Aug 19")
3. Better typography hierarchy - clear distinction between title, labels, and values
4. Add hover effects - subtle shadow elevation and slight scale on hover
5. Improved spacing and padding for better readability
6. Add subtle gradients or accent colors to make cards more visually appealing
7. Better use of the existing building type icons
8. Consistent border radius and card styling
9. Improved color scheme for the price displays
10. Subtle animations for hover states

File to edit: frontend/src/v2/pages/Dashboard.tsx

Use existing data:
- project.name (title)
- project.building_type (icon and type)
- project.square_footage 
- project.location
- construction_cost
- total_project_cost
- project.updated_at (for "last updated" timestamp)

For the timestamp, use formatters.relativeTime() or create display like:
- "Updated 2 hours ago"
- "Updated yesterday"
- "Updated Aug 19"

MUST FOLLOW PROJECT_CODING_STANDARDS.md:
- Frontend displays only - no calculations
- All data from backend via calculations.* or displayData.*
- Use formatters for all numbers
- Edit existing files only - no new files
- No hardcoded values
