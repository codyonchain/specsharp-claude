## ✅ Deployment Recommendation


### ✅ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

All critical tests are passing with a 100.0% success rate.

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Review deployment checklist
2. Verify production environment variables
3. Confirm auth bypass is DISABLED for production
4. Run production smoke tests after deployment
5. Monitor error rates for first 24 hours

**Pre-deployment Commands**:
```bash
# Final verification
ENVIRONMENT=production npm run test:critical

# Build production bundle
npm run build:production

# Deploy
npm run deploy
```


## 📝 Test Coverage Summary

### ✅ What's Tested
- All building types calculate correctly
